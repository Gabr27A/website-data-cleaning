# ðŸ§ª Website URL Data Cleaning & Field Extraction

This project demonstrates a typical data preparation task I encounter in digital marketing analytics: transforming raw website URLs into structured fields for analysis.

While the dataset is fictitious, the logic and workflow reflect real-world challenges I solve in my roleâ€”especially when preparing datasets for Tableau dashboards or performance reporting.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

- Extract the **subfolder** (channel/category) and **page name** from raw URLs.
- Clean and format the page name to be human-readable.
- Simulate joining external data sources using `VLOOKUP` in Excel (and `merge()` in Python).
- Showcase analytical thinking and real-world Excel functions for transformation; despite not memorizing syntax, I find solutions with tools like Google or ChatGPT.
